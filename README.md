# TRP-Helper v0.9
This is an original Vanilla addon (`Roleplaying Helper`), modified to include **TWoW custom races and minor fixes**.

# Beta Addon
While this addon has been taken from the original Vanilla release, it was missing many features and quotes everywhere. I have patched mistakes, added quotes and made some minor LUA fixes. I am not an expert on coding and my quotes may present mistakes.

If you notice any mistakes, wrong spelling, code flaws or you come up with new functions that could be added or want to help on the project (especially the coding side of it), message me on **the_vaas (Discord)** or **Vaaslite (in-game, Turtle WoW)**.

## Features
**TRPHelper is** meant to be **a tool to customize your gameplay** and enhance **immersion**. You will be able to have **fully customizable** quotes (`/s`) or emotes (`/e`) your character will perform under certain conditions. **These actions include:**
- Spells
- Combat actions (dodge, block, parry, hurt, crit)
- Pet orders (attack, stop, death)
- Combat end and start
- Resurrection
- NPC interaction
- Trade window
- Others

**More actions are planned to be added**, such as PvP contesting, racial actives and other API events.
## UI
To access the main menu, use the (`/rp`) command. 
The main menu grants access to Events, Spells, Quote List and Language.
- Events: Player performed events (log off, hearthstone, combat status).
- Spells: Class specific spells. You can modify the proc chance and delay of every event and spell action. It is recommended to assign higher delay and lower proc chance to the most common events so they don't become spam (entering combat, casting your main rotation spells...)
